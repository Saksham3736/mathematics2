### Question 1:

Use Taylor's theorm to expand _f(x,y)_ in powers of (x-1) and (y-2).

$$
f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2
$$

### Question 2:

Expand _f(x,y)_  in powers of x and y.

$$
f(x,y) = e^y \ln (1+x)
$$

### Question 3: 

Expand _f(x,y)_ at (0,0) in powers of x and y.

$$
f(x,y)= \cos{x} \cos{y}
$$

### Question 4:

Expand _f(x,y)_ by taylor series about (1,1) and hence find the value of _f(0.9,1.1)_

$$
f(x,y) = \tan^{-1} {(\frac{y}{x})}
$$

### Question 5: 

Using Differential calculus, calculate the approximate value of _y(1.997)_ where:

$$
y(x) = x^4 - 2x^3 + 9x +7
$$

### Question 6: 

The time __T__ of a complete qscillation of a simple pendulum of length _L_ is governed by the equation of:
 $$T = 2 \pi \sqrt \frac {L}{g}$$ 
 , where _g_ is constant. Find the error in __T__ , where error in _L_ is 2%.

### Question 7: 

The diameter and height of a right circular cylinder are measured to be  5 and 8 inches respectively. If each of these dimensions may be in error of:  
$$\pm 0.1 inch$$
, find the relative percentage error in volume of the cylinder.

### Question 8:
What are the advantages of lagrange's method over the ordinary method of calculating maxima and minima ?

### Question 9: 

Find the maximum and minimum values of:
$$f(x,y)= x^3 + 3xy^2 -15^2 -15y^2 + 72x$$

### Question 10: 

Find the shortest distance from the origin to the surface:
$$xyz^2=2$$

### Question 11: 

Find the shortest distance from the origin to the plane: 
$$x-2y-2z=3$$

### Question 12: 

Find the volumw of the largest rectangular parallelopiped with edges parallel to the axes, that can be inscribed in the 

(i) sphere:
 $$x^2+y^2+z^2=a^2$$
(ii) ellipsoid:
 $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2}=1$$

### Question 13: 

Find the dimensions of a rectangukar box, with open top, so that the total surface area of the box is a minimum, given that the volume of the box is constant say V.

### Question 14: 

Find the minimum and the maximum distances from the origin to the curve:
$$3x^2+4xy+6y^2=140.$$

### Question 15: 

Find the minimum value of:
$$x^2+y^2+z^2$$
subject to the condition: 
$$\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} +\frac{1}{z} = 1$$ 


### Question 16: 

Find the extreme value of:
$$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$
along with this condition:  
$$13x^2-10xy+13y^2=72$$

### Question 17: 

Find thye maximum and minimum distance of the point (3,4,12) from the given sphere using lagrange's method.

sphere: 
$$x^2+y^2+z^2=1$$
